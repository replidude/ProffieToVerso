# ProffieToVerso
Converting lightsaber sound fonts from the Proffie format to the Verso. Download the latest .exe file, titled "proftoVerso.exe" to use.

The latest version includes an updated UI, making use of the converter easier

This program is still a work in progress, as I continue to optimize the conversion process, and am working on skimming config files to output the optimal font settings for use with the verso soundboard. 

It currently works with most available proffie sound fonts, including those made by kyberphonic and greyscale fonts.
