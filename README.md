# ProffieToVerso
Converting lightsaber sound fonts from the Proffie format to the Verso. Download the latest .exe file in the Current EXE folder to use.

This program is still a work in progress, as I continue to optimize the conversion process, and am working on skimming config files to output the optimal font settings for use with the verso soundboard. 

It currently works with most available proffie sound fonts, including kyberphonic and greyscale fonts.
